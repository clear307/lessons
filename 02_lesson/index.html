        <h3 id="cook">How to cook Borshch</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 200 C. Put pork ribs on the baking dish and bake
            them within 30 min. Wash the celery root, but don’t peel it. Take
            the carrot and cut both of them in medium pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put baked pork ribs in a pot and pour 3 liters of water there. Add
            cutted celery root and carrot together with the not peeled onion
            half. Bring the pot to a boiling condition. After that, make a
            medium fire and continue boiling for 30min.
          </li>
          <li>
            The heart of the borshch are pre roasted vegetables. Dice a bell
            pepper, and do the same with tomatoes and the onion. Place the
            butter on a saucepan and add vegetables. Cook them over a moderate
            heat to soften vegetables, after that add two tbsp of tomato paste,
            reduce the heat and keep on stewing them for 5-7 minutes. Also grate
            a beet and put it in the saucepan too and stew them all together for
            3-4 more minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut a garlic bulb in a half and add it to the pot. Shred the cabbage
            and put it aside, we will add it later.
          </li>
          <li>
            We need a beet juice, so take the second beet and squeeze all juices
            out of that boy. If you don’t have a juice squeezer, you can grate a
            beet and squeeze it through the sieve. Then add the juice together
            with allspice, bay leaves and several pinches of salt (to your
            taste).
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also add canned beans, if you want so. It is an optional
            upgrade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put smoked pears in a pot. They will make your dish smell smoky.
          </li>
          <li>
            Congratulations, out borscht is almost ready. Now you can add a
            shredded cabbage and within five minutes you can put the pot aside
            the heat. Give borscht the rest. It deserves it. Wait for 30
            minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Serve the borscht together with a spoon of sour cream and chopped
          dill. <br />
